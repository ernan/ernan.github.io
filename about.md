I watched a documentary [shackled](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/shackledtosilence). In that documentary Eric Briggs who said that the moon had changed ts position relative to the earth.

Initially I though this was ridiculous and would be easy to disprove. I bought a new phone for Christmas so I said I would take a photo to test the theory.
