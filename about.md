# The moon rotation project

This project has three very simple goals

1. Determine if the moon is actually rotating. This is important. If this is happening it seems unlikely that NASA etc. have missed this. What we will do here is add every bit of information we can find and put that information in front of NASA et all.

2. Provided 1 is true. Determine what is causing the moon to rotate.

3. Determine what will be the effect of this new rotation.
