# The moon is rotating in the sky

This website aims to do three things

1. Demonstrate and show the rotation.
2. Determine the reason for the rotation.
3. Determine the impact of this rotation.

## Demonstrating the moon is rotating

1.  All photographs were taken using a Samsung Galaxy note 20 plus. 
2.  I took a full shot this would include the moon and the ground. This is to show I am not tilting the camera while taking the shot.
3.  I then took another shot a close up (x50 magnification on the moon). The close up is always taken from the same positions as the full shot.
4. In the collage I highlight some easy to spot areas of the moon
     a. The "Rabbit Ears" Sea of Nectar and Sea of Fertility
     b. The "Rabbits lunch" Sea of Clouds
