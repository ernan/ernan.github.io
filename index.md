# The moon is rotating in the sky

This website will serve three purposes

1. Demonstrate and show the rotation.
2. Determine the reason for the rotation.
3. Determine what impact this change in rotation will have on our life.

## Demonstrating the moon is rotating

I took many photographs of the moon.
I took a full shot this would include the moon and the ground so that it is obvious that I am taking a pictured of the moon relative to the ground (horizon)
I then took another shot a close up (x50 magnification on the moon)
The close up is always taken from the same positions oas the full shot.

## Moon Rotation 2021/01/25

I have highlighted two distinctive areas of the moon so you can see it is rotation 
The "Rabbet Ears" Sea of Nectar and Sea of Fertility
The "Rabbets lunch" Sea of Clouds

Notice that the rotation does not start until 21:30
